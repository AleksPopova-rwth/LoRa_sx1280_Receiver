# LoRa_sx1280_Receiver

## Overview

The `LoRa_sx1280_Receiver` project implements a receiver using the SX1280 transceiver module for LoRa-based communication. This project demonstrates how to receive and process LoRa signals. Notably, I wrote a custom library for communication without relying on the official LoRa library from Semtech, allowing for a more tailored approach to the hardware and protocol.

## Features

- LoRa signal reception using the SX1280 module
- Custom library implementation (no use of Semtech's LoRa library)
- Suitable for long-range communication projects

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AleksPopova-rwth/LoRa_sx1280_Receiver.git
